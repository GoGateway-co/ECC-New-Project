# ECC Project Template

## First-time setup
Run `/start-new-project` to initialize this project's roadmap, goals, and first session.

## Resuming work
When the user says "continue":
1. Read `docs/roadmap.json` and the latest files in `docs/sessions/`
2. List active/pending workstreams with their latest session file
3. Ask which one to resume
4. Load that session's Continue block and begin
